Project 1: Maru Batting Center

Introduction
Maru Batting Center(MBC) is a batting cage facility in Tokyo which provides batting cages with baseball and softball pitching machines. MBC divides its customers into four primary segments, each of them has their own price sensitivity, frequency of using and attrition rate.
In this project, we explore the customer targeting strategy and make decisions on whether it is profitable for MBC to implement new strategies or adopt new promotions based on CLV model.
